# Real-Time Face Blurring with OpenCV README

## Introduction

This repository contains Python code for a real-time face blurring application using OpenCV. Two scripts are provided, each demonstrating a different level of face anonymization.
Video Demo:
```bash

```
### Code 1 - Face Detection and Outline

The first script detects faces in a webcam feed and outlines them with random-colored rectangles.

### Code 2 - Face Blurring

The second script builds upon the first by not only detecting faces but also applying a Gaussian blur to anonymize them in real-time.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have OpenCV installed. You can install it using:

  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

- Download the Haar Cascade XML file for face detection and place it in the same directory as the script. You can find it [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-face-blurring.git
   cd real-time-face-blurring
   ```

2. Download the Haar Cascade XML file and place it in the same directory.

3. Run the desired script:

   ```bash
   python face_detection.py
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python face_blurring.py
   ```

4. Press the spacebar to exit the application.

## Code Explanation

- Both scripts use OpenCV to capture frames from the webcam and detect faces.
- The first script outlines detected faces with random-colored rectangles.
- The second script takes face regions, applies Gaussian blur, and substitutes the original frames with blurred faces.

## Note

- Experiment with different Haar Cascade XML files for specialized object detection.
- Customize the blur parameters or color schemes to fit your requirements.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when using or modifying this code.
